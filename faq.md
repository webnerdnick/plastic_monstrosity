# Frequently Asked Questions

### How precise is it?
> Precision is a factor to how rigid the frame is, and how tight everything fits. Yes, you could get +/- .5 mm accuracy based on how well your components connect together and how rigid everything is overall. Remember, you're cutting wood, not sending something to the moon (well, maybe you are).

### How fast can it cut?
> Folks who have built it have stated an average range of 80-100 ipm (inches per minute) with 4mm deep cuts.

### What materials can it cut?
> Depending on the type of cutting bit, spindle RPMs, and cutting speed, you can cut a variety of materials, from plywood, MDF, solid wood, acrylic, form, and even aluminum

### How deep can it cut?
> If you use the printable parts, expect to get 2-1/2" - 3" max depth of cutting. If you use the Open Builds upgrades, you could cut deeper. The deeper you go, the cutting head gets further away from the gantry and you start to incorporate flex, which sacrifices accuracy.

### Can I attach something other than a router?
> Sure, with the proper printed gantry adapters you could connect virtually anything to the system. Markers, lasers, etc...
