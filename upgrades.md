# Possible Upgrades


## OpenBuilds Short Axis Gantry Mount

The following upgrades will replace the 3D printed parts with machined plates and parts from OpenBuilds. This would allow for a much more rigid setup for attaching spindles, increasing overall accuracy.

This aassumes that you've already purchased the C-Beams, motor, and threaded rod for the z-axis.

Eccentric spacers should only be needed on the top side of the gantry in order to snug up the wheels.
