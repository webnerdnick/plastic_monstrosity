## Generic Options

52mm, 70mm, and 80mm generic spindle mounts are also included in the printable parts, for a range of other available spindles. I do not have any specific experience or recomendations for a generic spindle.

*Use zAxis-52mm-spindle.stl, zAxis-70mm-spindle.stl, or zAxis-80mm-spindle.stl
