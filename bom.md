***You're not going to need all 600 of these connectors, you'll only need a handful to make extension cables for the stepper motors
to connect to the controller board. The stepper motors DO NOT come with plugs or long cables.

Also, 18 AWG wire is the smallest wire recommended (bigger the number, smaller the wire dia.), make sure you're purchasing stranded wire as well*

***The bore must match whatever shaft diameter is on your NEMA 23 motors. The more popular 6.35mm x 10mm wide pulleys were impossible to find, so I changed out my steppers to an 8mm bore, along with these pulleys.  Pay careful attention to the specs of the pulley. 20 teeth, 10mm wide.
****If you plan to use the upgrade of the Open Builds short axis gantry, you only need 4 Xtreme Mini V Wheels instead of 12, as you'll then need 8 Solid V wheels. (See [upgrades](upgrades.md) for BOM)*


# Nuts and Bolts

Out of convenience and better pricing, large packs of nuts and bolts are linked, though you may not need 50 of one thing, it'll still be cheaper than having to buy 30 at a local store. YMMV. I've tried to actualy list how many of each you'll actually use in case you want to get them locally.

*Note: Consider stainless steel or zinc options if your CNC machine will be exposed to humidity or stored in a garage or shed*

***You want slide-in, NOT drop-in tee nuts. The drop in are a pain to work with, but make sure you have the right amount of nuts in the slot before assembling or you'll have to take it apart to add a nut*
