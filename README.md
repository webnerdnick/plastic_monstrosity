# Plastic Monstrosity
## 3D Printable 4' x 8' CNC machine


The printable part files are originally sourced from spiffcow's git repo, and details and documentation have been compied from the Thingiverse project page at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2471313 and OpenBuilds here: https://openbuilds.com/builds/plastic-monstrosity.5353/

This repo was started as a way to further organize the project and make it easier for those wishing to build the project to understand how things come together.

### Original Summary of Project
> This is my massive CNC capable of cutting a full 4x8 sheet of plywood with room to spare! This is optimized specifically for cutting plywood, and I believe this is probably the least expensive way to build a CNC capable of accurately cutting plywood in a reasonable amount of time. There are other designs out there, but I've yet to see another one that maintains performance and accuracy while keeping the overall price below $1000 for a 4x8' cutting area. I really enjoyed designing and building this, and I hope it can help lower the barrier of entry for makers looking to build the kind of things you see on [OpenDesk](http://www.opendesk.cc) or [WikiHouse](https://wikihouse.cc/).


In a nutshell, this project uses 3D printable parts, tons of nuts and bolts, bearings, and some off the shelf parts from OpenBuilds, and 2" EMT conduit (or 60.3mmm conduit for European folks) for the long axis. For a complete listing of parts, please visit the BOM.

While the short axis is primarily determined by the length of the C-Beam you purchase from OpenBuilds, the long axis can be nearly any length, if space is limited.
