# Print Settings
The files provided here are intended for printing on a 3D FDM printer, like the Creality Ender 3, Prusa3D I3 MK3S, or similar brands.  A reasonable accuracy and resolution is required to build parts for accurate CNC cuts.

*Note: Some gantry pieces can be substituted using parts from OpenBuilds instead of 3D printing. Please visit the Possible Upgrades section.*


## Recommended Material

* High quality PETG is recommended over anything else
* PLA+/PLA Pro from brands like Atomic Filament or eSun would work as a good substitution with higher-infill
* Not recommended: Regular PLA, as it'll break down over time and you may experience issues with layer separation

## Infill

50% or higher. I printed my parts in eSun PLA+ with 55% infill

*Note: some parts like the Jig, and possibly the conduit supports can be printed with 20-25% infill

## Print Notes

* Print with high temps for good layer bonding
* 4 top and bottom layers
* 3 perimeters
